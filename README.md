# @clearlysid â€” personal website

This has been a long pending project which I'm finally putting together.

## Stack

1. 11ty
2. Notion
3. Barba
4. Anime

## Notes

Started this as a Gatsby site but I migrated it to NextJS to try out it's new SSG features, and cut down my build times.

As part of this project I also wrote a custom React renderer for Notion data, it can potentially be abstracted out of this project and used as a standalone package.
