# @clearlysid â€” personal website

This has been a long pending project which I'm finally putting together.

## Stack

1. [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) - React Framework, SSG
2. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop) - My jugaad pseudo-CMS
3. [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animations, Page Transitions
4. Styled Components

## Notes

Started this as a Gatsby site but I migrated it to NextJS to try out it's new SSG features, and cut down my build times.

As part of this project I also wrote a custom React renderer for Notion data, it can potentially be abstracted out of this project and used as a standalone package.
