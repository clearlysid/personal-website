# @clearlysid â€” personal website

This is an ongoing personal project which I've put together using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), [Notion](https://http://notion.so/), [Barba](https://barba.js.org), [Anime](https://animejs.com) and [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/).

Deployed on [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4fc3be70-90bc-44a2-80f0-8deebc83575a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sidds/deploys)

## Usage

If you want to clone this site for your own personal use, or as a starting point for a project, feel free to do so by all means. Although I will appreciate attribution, since I've spent a lot of time and effort on this. It would be a really shitty move if you literally passed this off as your own work.

### Instructions

1. `yarn dev` will spin up a development server
2. `yarn build` will build a static, production ready site
3. `yarn clean` will remove the existing build and cache

## Further Plans

As part of this project I also wrote an HTML renderer for Notion data, it can potentially be abstracted out of this project and used as a standalone package. I will likely get around to it at some point and but you're also welcome to give it a shot.

There's a lot more design and animation work still to be done, plus I'm thinking of exploring sound and 3D in the browser as part of this project.

As my life changes around me, this website will continue to evolve alongside it.
