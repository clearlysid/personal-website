# Colophon

> When used in reference to websites, a colophon is a description of the tools, systems and resources used to create the site and keep it operational. It also serves to acknowledge and give credit to all of them.

Hi, I'm @clearlysid and this is my personal website. It evolves as I do â€” the design, and underlying technologies keep changing as I grow and learn new things. Things break often and radical design changes happen overnight. [No really](https://twitter.com/clearlysid/status/1394198294193086465?s=20).

### Current Stack

1. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), the best static site generator in town
2. Most words were written in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
3. I design things in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
4. Typeset in [Antarctica Betri](https://beta.newglyph.com/classic-collection/#font-antarctica) by NewGlyph
5. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice
6. The most robust web-animations tool [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
7. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) handles image optimization and hosting
8. Deployed via [![Netlify](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4fc3be70-90bc-44a2-80f0-8deebc83575a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sidds/deploys)

In the past, I've used Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Gatsby and NextJS to power this site: but for a project this size, 11ty was a clear winner. I adore the JAMstack and try to keep my codebase lean if I can.

### To-Do

-   [ ] Make homepage responsive
-   [ ] Fluid typography and layouts
-   [ ] Page transitions
-   [ ] Migrate lifelog to this codebase
-   [ ] Modular CSS structure
-   [ ] Add case studies
-   [ ] Add site-level navigation

### Developer Reference

Under the hood, I use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to process my JS and SCSS.

1. To spin up a dev server: `yarn dev`
2. Build it for production: `yarn build`
3. Alternately, use `yarn prod` for a prod-build and serve it up locally
