Think of this page as a style-guide. Here I list down all the elements from my blog and experiment with their styling. It's a jumping off point to get your type, colors and component styles locked in for the site. The content of this page doesn't particularly make sense so I wouldn't bother reading.

I used to power this site from [Notion](https://www.notion.so) with a renderer that I wrote, but given how complex the data structures became over time â€” it quickly started to feel hard to maintain. Every time Notion would update their architecture, my renderer would break until I made appropriate connections.

## Back to Markdown

I moved all my notes back to good ol' `markdown`, but I do miss the flexibility. I'd become used to the plethora of block types available in Notion: todos, callouts, fancy embeds, kanban. It'll take a while to unlearn all my muscle memory for those and pare them all down.

### Vanilla markdown elements

1. paragraphs
2. a few headings
3. lists like this one
4. quotes
5. media
    - images
    - videos
6. Oh, and code blocks but that's about it.

> This is what a quote looks like. ðŸ§±

Within running text, here's what an image looks like on it's own:

![The last little frond on an unhappy indoor palm](https://res.cloudinary.com/clearlysid/image/upload/v1638008318/photo-1516825513084-7a3397fcd108_clmwnx.jpg)

Each image should also be accompanied a caption explaining what the image is about.


## Next Steps

There may be ways for me to spin some styling over the basics and still arrive at something unique for this site.
