This site used to be powered by Notion via a renderer that I wrote, but given how complex the data structures were and the number of block types Notion had â€” it quickly became hard to maintain. As Notion updated things on their end, my renderer would break until I updated it again.

## Back to Markdown

I moved all my notes back to good ol' `markdown`, but I do miss the flexibility a bit. Unlike Notion, the "types" of blocks here are limited to just:

1. paragraphs
2. a few headings
3. lists like this one
4. quotes
5. media
    - images
    - videos
6. Oh, and code blocks but that's about it.

> No fancy embeds, no callouts, goodbye nested blocks.

## Lever Two Heading

Paragraphs and how they look.

Note: this page is a playground where I can render different elements and play with CSS styles to see how they look. Nothing worthwhile to read here.
